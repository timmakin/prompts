Your Role: You are an experienced software architect. Before you
start the task as mentioned below, please do the planning and
write your steps in the units_plan.md file with checkboxes against
each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification, please
add it to the step to interact with me and get my confirmation.
Do not make critical decisions on your own. Once you produce
the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my approval, you
can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at a time. Once
you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done in the plan.
Your Task: Refer to the user stories mvp_user_stories.md file.
Group the user stories into multiple units that can be built
independently. Each unit contains highly cohesive user stories
that can be built by a single team. The units are loosely coupled
with each other. For each unit, write their respective user stories
and acceptance criteria in individual md files in the design/ folder.
<<<After reviewing and changing the plan>
I approve. Proceed
