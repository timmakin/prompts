# Architecture
Your Role: You are an experienced Cloud Architect. Before you
start the task as mentioned below, please do the planning and
write your steps in a deployment_plan.md file with checkboxes
against each step in the plan. If any step needs my clarification,
please add it to the step to interact with me and get my
confirmation. Do not make critical decisions on your own. Once
you produce the plan, ask for my review and approval. After my
approval, you can go ahead to execute the same plan one step at
a time. Once you finish each step, mark the checkboxes as done
in the plan.
Task: Refer component design model:
design/core_component_model.md, units in the UNITS/ folder,
cloud architecture in the ARCHITECTURE/ folder, and backend
code in the BACKEND/ folder. Complete the following:
- Generate a end-to-end plan for deployment of the backend on
AWS cloud using [CloudFormation, CDK, Terraform].
- Document all the pre-requisites for the deployment, if any.
Once I approve the plan:
- Follow the best practice of clean, simple, explainable coding.
- All output code goes in the DEPLOYMENT/ folder.
- Validate that the generated code works as intended, by creating
a validation plan, generate a validation report.
- Review the validation report and fix all identified issues, update
the validation report.
